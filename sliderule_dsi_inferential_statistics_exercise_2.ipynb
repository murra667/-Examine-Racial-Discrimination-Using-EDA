    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "4) In the case of whether or not the data suggest racial discrimination in job call-backs based on racially coded resume names, the p-value of 0.00002 at a .05 level of significance produced through a two-sided proportions z-test leads to a rejection of the null hypothesis; that the proportion of callbacks for white names by the true population of employers is less than or equal to the proportion of callbacks for black names. In other words, there is a .002% chance that the null hypothesis holds true for the true population given the data collected. The alternative hypothesis - that black resumes receive less callbacks than white resumes - should be accepted. A confidence interval calculated for the data suggests that 95% of the time, the difference between the proportion of white resume and black resume callbacks will be between 1.7% and 4.7%, with a chance that the difference between the two will be 1.5% below or above this interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) While the results of a z-test investigating a significant difference in resume callbacks can help answer the question of whether or not racial discrimination exists in the marketplace, merely performing a z-test is not enough to say that this is the most important factor in callback success. The analysis analysis could be ammended by performing a multivariate linear regression across several variables defined as important. This will allow for somewhat of a control in determining which variable has the greatest statistically significant correlation with callbak success. "
